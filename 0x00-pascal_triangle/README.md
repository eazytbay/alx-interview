# Implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python

## Pascal's Triangle Overview

In mathematics, [Pascal's triangle] is a triangular arrangement of binomial coefficients that is significant in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.

## Task Description:

Create a function named `def pascal_triangle(n)`: that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s triangle up to the nth row.

- The function should return an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- You can assume that `n` will always be an integer.
